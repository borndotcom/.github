Born creates AI friends — friends that enter people’s lives at the right moment and stay for a lifetime. These friends are always there when needed most, making conversations, play, and connection fun. At the intersection of AI and consumer social, Born is building experiences that feel natural, joyful, and lasting.

The new funding will accelerate Born’s product roadmap and hiring of top consumer AI talent. This includes opening a US office in New York, scaling new characters for Pengu, and launching a new social AI product currently seeing strong traction in stealth.

Born is backed by investors such as Supercell Co-Founder Ilkka Paananen, King Co-Founder Riccardo Zacconi, former Adobe CPO and A24 partner Scott Belsky, and The Chainsmokers’s Alexander Pall. Accel, who led Born's seed round, participated in the Series A alongside Tencent and Laton Ventures.

Born is establishing itself as a leader in consumer AI by building virtual friends that grow, evolve, and connect like humans. Unlike chatbot-centric or roleplay platforms, Born creates social, emotionally resonant, and culturally relevant companions that feel like real friends—the foundation for the next generation of consumer products.

Since launching in 2022, Born has released five #1 global social apps. Its flagship AI character, Pengu—raised, played with, and even “co-parented” by friends and family—has reached more than 15 million users globally, becoming the biggest AI character app with its own IP in the US. Born has now raised $25M to cement its position as leader in consumer AI by creating companions that feel alive, grow with users, and fit into daily life—moving beyond chatbot experiences toward social, emotionally resonant, and culturally relevant AI friends.
